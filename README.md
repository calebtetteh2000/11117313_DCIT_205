In order to clone the repository, we need to install git on our machine, after that we determine which repository to clone, in this case it's the DCIT_205_IA repository. We then copy the URL of the repository. We open terminal and navigate to the directory where we want to clone the repository. We enter the command git clone <repository url> to clone the repository. To set up the project, we navigate to newly cloned repository using the change directory command "cd". We reviewavailable branches and switch to the specific branch we want.
This project has taught me how github works and how to link it to vcode and also some tags in html i was not familiar with. Overall, this project has taught me to be creative in solving problems and applying new technologies to projects given to me.
